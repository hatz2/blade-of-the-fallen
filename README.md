# Blade of the Fallen

This is the first game that I have ever made. It is a small 2D game developed in [Godot v4.2](https://godotengine.org/) for a college subject. The main goal of the project was to create a game with intelligent enemies. We had completely freedom over the characteristics of the game, the design, the AI methods and the art. The AI in my game was made using [Finite State Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) and the [State](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html) design pattern.

## Characteristics of the game

* Platforms: PC (windows and linux)
* Genre: 2D platformer and roguelike
* Keyboard inputs
* Intelligent enemies
* UI: start menu, options menu, life and coins indicators
* Autosave configuration
